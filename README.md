Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well
- Add more buttons to change layout of the background and labels


App Brainstorming

- ai dj that helps you find new music with your past likes

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
- BioScan is an app used to help users make environmental-friendly choices in their daily lives. The app would use image recognition to provide an analysis for the product that was scanned. Users would simply scan the barcode of the product or take a picture of its ingredients and it would come up with a score. This score would be based on the ingredients and its impact on health, as well as carbon footprint and how they get or make the materials/ingredients. Users can track their scans, compete with friends, and set their sustainability goals. This app aims to help everyone make small but powerful choices that help the environment little by little.
